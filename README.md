# todo-backend-node-koa

## Overview
This is a [todo backend](http://todobackend.com) implementation using Node.js and [Koa](https://koajs.com/).

## Usage
To run the application using Docker, navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

## Note
I would like to mention that my friend, Aria Darmanger, helped me in setting up the Docker environment. As this is my first time working with Docker, I asked for his help for this aspect of the project. I believe this aligns with the spirit of the Milestone, which focuses more on backend development than on the environment setup.
